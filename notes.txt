    - Ie from start cache last 5-10 advertisements (one might get deleted and therefore fuck up)
        - If we see one of those URLs then stop going back
    - Dont go further than 1 day ie. Or hard limit to 20 advertisements
    - Maybe dont need it after all if we do it all 5 minutes. Then we are always on page 1 and can just see if we already have it
