- Whitelist domains as not to be redirect to other sketchy domains? (colly.AllowedDomains)
- Check ob passend
    - Not Tauschwohnung / Zwischenmiete
    - PLZ/Ort passt
    - Tag Nicht 1, 1.5 Zimmer
    - Unter 40qm im Tag nicht

- Need mechanism to know how far back to go.
    - Ie from start cache last 5-10 advertisements (one might get deleted and therefore fuck up)
        - If we see one of those URLs then stop going back
    - Dont go further than 1 day ie. Or hard limit to 20 advertisements
    - Maybe dont need it after all if we do it all 5 minutes. Then we are always on page 1 and can just see if we already have it
        in our data storage.

- Read URLs from env to make it generic
- Start the program all 10 minutes should be alright
    --> Load map into cache
    --> Check for all ads on page if the url matches on in map
    --> If not there yet --> Other checks
    --> If all checks passed --> Add into list

TODO 11.03
 - Load from file into map (key is URL, should be unique) DONE
 - When adding check if URL already exist DONE
 - When adding check if is in quarter PLZ (maybe blacklisting is easier?)
